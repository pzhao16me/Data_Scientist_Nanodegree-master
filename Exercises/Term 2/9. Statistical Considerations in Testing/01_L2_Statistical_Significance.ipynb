This experiment has been designed to have a cookie-based diversion, and we record two things from each user: which page version they received, and whether or not they accessed the download page during the data recording period.

    "## Checking the Invariant Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we should check that the number of visitors assigned to each group is similar. It's important to check the invariant metrics as a prerequisite so that our inferences on the evaluation metrics are founded on solid ground. If we find that the two groups are imbalanced on the invariant metric, then this will require us to look carefully at how the visitors were split so that any sources of bias are accounted for. It's possible that a statistically significant difference in an invariant metric will require us to revise random assignment procedures and re-do data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to do a two-sided hypothesis test on the proportion of visitors assigned to one of our conditions. Choosing the control or the experimental condition doesn't matter: you'll get the same result either way. Feel free to use whatever method you'd like: we'll highlight two main avenues below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take a simulation-based approach, you can simulate the number of visitors that would be assigned to each group for the number of total observations, assuming that we have an expected 50/50 split. Do this many times (200 000 repetitions should provide a good speed-variability balance in this case) and then see in how many simulated cases we get as extreme or more extreme a deviation from 50/50 that we actually observed. Don't forget that, since we have a two-sided test, an extreme case also includes values on the opposite side of 50/50. (e.g. Since simulated outcomes of .48 and lower are considered as being more extreme than an actual observation of 0.48, so too will simulated outcomes of .52 and higher.) The proportion of flagged simulation outcomes gives us a p-value on which to assess our observed proportion. We hope to see a larger p-value, insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take an analytic approach, you could use the exact binomial distribution to compute a p-value for the test. The more usual approach, however, is to use the normal distribution approximation. Recall that this is possible thanks to our large sample size and the central limit theorem. To get a precise p-value, you should also perform a \n",
    "continuity correction, either adding or subtracting 0.5 to the total count before computing the area underneath the curve. (e.g. If we had 415 / 850 assigned to the control group, then the normal approximation would take the area to the left of $(415 + 0.5) / 850 = 0.489$ and to the right of $(435 - 0.5) / 850 = 0.511$.)\n",
